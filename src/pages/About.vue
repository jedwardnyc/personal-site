    <h1>About</h1>
    <v-content>
      I am a developer. Hire me.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I am a perfect blend of  artist and engineer. 
      I approach software engineering with experience from my theatre 
      background which gives me an eye for detail
      and the ability to solve problems in a way that others can't. 
      Whether it is acting, designing, coding, or solving puzzles
      in my free time, I attack it with a willingness to learn and find
      new ways to achieve my goals. People tend to say, "If there's a 
      will, there's a way," but I'm striving to find the other way that
      is more efficient, exciting, and new.
